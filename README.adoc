= `GmailSafe v0.0.1`

The goal of this project is to implement a https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[`Spring Boot`] Web Java application that communicates with a GMail inbox account using https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/[`GMail API`].

== Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/backups`
- `POST /api/v1/backups`
- `GET /api/v1/backups/exports/{backupId}`
- `GET /api/v1/backups/exports/{backupId}/{label}`

== Running the application without credentials

. You need to enable the GMail API. In order to do it, access this website https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/java and follow the instructions in `Step 1: Turn on the GMail API`. Write down `client_id` and `client_secret` or just download the `credentials.json` file. It contains the credentials that will be used on the next steps.

. Open a terminal and inside `springboot-gmail` folder, run the following command
+
[source]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

. You need to get a `code` from Google. Open a browser and access the link below informing the `client_id` and the scope you allow the application to have.
+
WARNING: In the example below, we are using https://mail.google.com. It allows full access to the account! For more about scopes, please check https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes.
+
[source]
----
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=https://mail.google.com&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/callback
----

. Choose the Google account and allow `GmailSafe` to access your Google Account. You will get the `code` in the response

. Open a new terminal and run the following command, replacing `CODE`, `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with the ones you got in the steps above.
+
[source]
----
curl -i -X POST https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v4/token \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "code=CODE" \
  -d "client_id=CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/callback"
----

. Finally, set `client_id`, `client_secret` and `refresh_token` in the `application.yml` and restart the application.

. **Done!** Once you have the credentials set in `application.yml` and they are valid, you don't need to do all those steps again.

== Running the application with GMail credentials already set

Open a new terminal and inside `springboot-gmail` folder run

[source]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
== Running the jar (GMail credentials already set will return mail from my account)
[source]
----
java -jar <location of the jar>/springboot-gmail-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

== Testing with Swagger(not recommended for zip download endpoints)
[source]
----
Open the following location http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
----

== Some curl calls

[source]
----
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/v1/backups
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/v1/backups/exports/{backupId}
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/v1/backups/exports/{backupId}/{label}
